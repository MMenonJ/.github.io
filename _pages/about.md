I am currently pursuing a master's degree at University of Alberta under the supervision of Professor [Marlos C. Machado](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~machado/). Currently I am working on reinforcement learning, particularly option discovery within environments featuring partial observability. 

My educational background includes a bachelor's degree in mechatronics engineering, with an undergraduate thesis centered on the applications of robotics using reinforcement learning. Subsequently, I pursued a master's degree in computer engineering, collaborating with a group specialized in Natural Language Processing (NLP). During this period, I studied the integration of reinforcement learning techniques for addressing complex questions in question answering systems, particularly those involving multi-hop scenarios which necessitated iterative retrieval sequences with professor [Fabio G. Cozman](http://sites.poli.usp.br/p/fabio.cozman/).
